What is Operating system?
An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling interaction through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).

Why is an OS Important?
.Without an OS, users would need to manually control hardware (impossible for modern computers).
.Enables software like browsers, games, and apps to run.
.Manages resources efficiently (CPU, RAM, storage).
.Provides security against malware and unauthorized access.

What is Linux?
Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel that powers many distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.
Known for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux is widely used in servers, cloud computing, and development environments.
Unlike Windows or macOS, itâ€™s highly customizable and runs efficiently even on older hardware
